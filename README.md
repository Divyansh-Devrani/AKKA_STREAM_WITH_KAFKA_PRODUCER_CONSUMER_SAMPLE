# AKKA_STREAM_WITH_KAFKA_PRODUCER_CONSUMER_SAMPLE
AKKA STREAM AND KAFKA SAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE CREATED A PRODUCER WHICH TAKES A LIST CONTAINING FEW WORD AND IT WILL COUNT THE ALPHABET IN THAT WORD AND THEN CONSUMER WILL CONSUME THAT AND WILL SHOW THE NO OF ALPHABET PRESENT IN THAT WORD. THIS SAMPLE PROJECT WILL TELL US HOW WE CAN CREATE KAFKA PRODUCER AND CONSUMER AND HOW WE CAN USE THEM WITH AKKA STREAM.
